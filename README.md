# Fuzzy_TOPSIS
"Fuzzy TOPSIS" refers to a decision-making technique that combines the traditional "Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution" (TOPSIS) with fuzzy logic, allowing decision-makers to incorporate uncertainty and vagueness into their evaluations by using fuzzy numbers instead of crisp values when assessing alternatives against multiple criteria; essentially, it enables a more nuanced approach to ranking options when dealing with subjective or imprecise information.

Key points about Fuzzy TOPSIS: 
• Handles ambiguity: Unlike standard TOPSIS, fuzzy TOPSIS allows decision-makers to express their preferences using fuzzy sets, which can represent ranges of values instead of single points, making it better suited for situations with uncertainty or linguistic evaluations.

• Multi-criteria decision making: Like traditional TOPSIS, it is used to rank multiple alternatives based on various criteria, but with the added benefit of fuzzy logic to handle complex decision-making scenarios.

• Positive and negative ideal solutions: The method still calculates the distance between each alternative and a "positive ideal solution" (representing the best possible outcome) and a "negative ideal solution" (representing the worst possible outcome) to determine the ranking.

• Applications: Fuzzy TOPSIS is commonly used in various fields where decision-making involves subjective judgments, such as supplier selection, project evaluation, investment analysis, and personnel selection.
